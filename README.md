## Installation
faker, jest, supertest, test,socket.io, socket.io-client

## Summary of Problem Domain
In Phase 2, weâ€™ll be changing the underlying networking implementation of our CAPS system from using node events to using a library called socket.io so that we can do networked events. Socket.io manages the connection pool for us, makes broadcasting much easier to operate, and works well both on the terminal (between servers) and with web clients.

## User Stories
